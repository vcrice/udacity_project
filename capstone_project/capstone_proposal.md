## Proposal

### Domain Background

*(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)*

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death[2]. According to WHO data: In 2017, an estimated 219 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and cause 435 000 deaths. Most cases were in the WHO Africa Region[3].

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. [1]. 

According to CDC U.S., microscopy examination remains the "gold standard" for laboratory confirmation of malaria. By visually inspecting the blood smear specimen collected from patient under the microscopy , the laboratorian can determined if this patient is infected. However, the proficiency of laboratorian becomes a problem.

### Problem Statement

*(approx. 1 paragraph)*

1. In  some non-tropical regions , malaria became rare (average 1700 cases in ths U.S per year), the laboratorians does not perform this test regularly.
2. In some regions which are lack of medical resources (also suffered the most), well-trained Medical personnel who are able to justify test result, also hard to find.

Base on previous statements, we can implement machine learning on the task classifying the microscopy images ,make the justification much more easier for medical personnel who may not so familiared with this task. 

### Datasets and Inputs

*(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)*

The datasets comes from <https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/>. The cell images of Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients were collected and photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh.

The dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells.

### Solution Statement

*(approx. 1 paragraph)*

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model

*(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)*

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics

*(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)*

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design

*(approx. 1 page)*

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
